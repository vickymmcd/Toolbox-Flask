# Toolbox Feedback for MP5

## AI and Algorithms
I thought this toolbox was very good at teaching me about moving a character
around on a board. I learned more about logic and understanding where a
character could move to. I also learned a bit about key events and how we can
detect them. I also learned a little about the concept of an AI but not as much
as I would have liked to learn about what AI is and how I could implement it
outside this context.

## Pickling
This toolbox was extremely effective in teaching me how to use pickling in
my projects. I found myself using this skill extensively in other projects
after learning it from this toolbox.

## Word Frequency
The word frequency toolbox was very useful in my text mining project. I found
it extremely helpful know how to count the frequency of certain words in a
block of text. It was easy to apply to other projects and to understand
everything I was doing.

## Machine learning
I must say although I enjoyed doing the machine learning toolbox, I do not think
it really taught me machine learning. I have been working on machine learning
in some of my other projects and that has been much more helpful in understanding
what machine learning is and does. I felt like the parts of the code that we
wrote for this toolbox were not super related to the concept of machine learning
and we could certainly have been asked to write more of the machine learning
code ourselves.

## Flask
This toolbox was very helpful in teaching me how to write a simple web application.
It has been very helpful as a platform for starting off what we are doing for my
team's final project which involves a web interface. As someone who has built
websites with html, css, and javascript before, it was very cool to see how
Flask can be used to integrate these processes.

## Web Deployment
I have not gotten a chance to test whether I will be able to apply this skill
to another project yet. That said, I feel confident that I will and it was very
cool being able to see how easy it is to deploy a website to the internet. I
always thought this was something that took a lot of time and money and seeing
that it could be done in a short time span for free was very eye opening and
cool for me. It was also cool because I liked that I was able to build off
the Flask toolbox and see a website that I had actually made go live on the web.
